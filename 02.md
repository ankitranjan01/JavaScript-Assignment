####Write a regular expression  to reverse the first and last name
```regex

```


####Write a Regular expression to validate email address

####Find the Output
```javascript
 var x = 100;
    console.log(x);
     
    function test(){
        var x = 250;
        console.log(x);
     
        if (x > 100) {
            let x = 350;
            console.log(x);
        }
     
        console.log(x);
    }
     
    test();
    console.log(x);
```

####What is the difference of output between these two expressions? Give your reasons for it:
12 == “12”
12 === “12”
Number(12) === 12

```javascript
12 == "12"//This will return true as '==' is an equality operator and checks whether the operands are equal or not.
12 === “12”//This will return false as '==' is an strict equality operator and checks whether the operands as well as the Data type is equal.
Number(12) === 12 //This will return true. Number() returns the string in it to Number.
````
####What is NaN?
NaN stands for "Not a Number" and is a special value in JavaScript used to indicate that a value is not a legal number. It is often returned when attempting to perform a mathematical operation that cannot be performed.

For example, dividing 0 by 0 will return NaN.
