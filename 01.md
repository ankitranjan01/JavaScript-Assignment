##Write a program that declares a variable using var, let, and const and prints the value to the console.

'''
var name = "Ankit Ranjan"

let age = 22

const  g = 9.8

console.log("My name is " + name + " with Age " + age + " and the value of g is " + g)
'''

##Write a program that reassigns a value to a variable declared with let and prints the new value to the console.

'''
age = 23

console.log("And the New age is " + age)
'''

##Write a program that tries to reassign a value to a variable declared with const and prints the message to the console

'''
g = 10.0 //TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
'''

This will throw an error as the const can not be reassigned and also can't be redeclared.

##Write a program to declare a const, let, var variable within an if statement and try to access the variable outside the if block, what is the result?

'''
if(true){
    //using const 
    const a = 1

    //declartion using let
    let b = 2

    //declartion using var
    var c = 3
}

console.log(a)  //ReferenceError: a is not defined
console.log(b)  //ReferenceError: b is not defined
console.log(c)  // prints 3

'''
a and b can't be used  outside the 'if' block as const and let creates block scoped constant and variable.

##Write a program that concatenates two or more strings and prints the result to the console.

'''
console.log("Hello"+ " " + "world" + "!") 
'''

##Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the length of the string to the console.

'''
var string  = prompt("Enter a String to print: ")
length = string.length

console.log("The length of the string is " + length)
'''

##Write a program that converts a string to uppercase and prints the result to the console.

'''
const string = "hello world!";
const upperCase = string.toUpperCase();
console.log(upperCase);
'''
